# page navigator

Here we are using react-router and react-router-dom library for navigation.

We have three route which is defined as Home '/' which renders the <code>Home</code> component 
second route is profile route which render <code>Profile</code> component
third route is contact route which render <code> contact </code> component

MOdify the codeChanger function in <code>topbar</code> component such that when we click profile button then profile page appear , when we click home then home page appear and when contact button is pressed then contact page appear 

you cann't have more than one onClick function in topbar component 

You also need to modify <ColorSelector> component accordingly
